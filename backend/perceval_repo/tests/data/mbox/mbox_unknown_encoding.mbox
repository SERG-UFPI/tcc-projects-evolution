Hi,
   In my application, the main thread creats the UI, and another thread collects
data that should be showed in UI.
   I want to refresh the UI when collecting is completed, but when I called
SomeControl.refreshUI(), I got a "thread invalid access" exception. I saw the
source of SWT, and found that Display check whether current thread is the thread
created UI.
   My qustion is, how can I refresh the control which created by main thread in
another thread?
   Thanks
