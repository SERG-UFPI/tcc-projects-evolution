Hey,

you might have heard of Docker [1].
I like to get your opinion this.

Background:
I thought about creating Docker containers with automated builds for some
MetricsGrimoire tools.
They can be use for development or testing purpose.

To be able to automate the builds (and be up to date at new releases) a
connection between DockerHub and the MetricsGrimoire Github Organisation
would make sense. But my rights are not enough at this.
That is the reason for this mail.

This is cool, Andy.

Which rights do you need?

If you are fine with it i would create an Organisation on Dockerhub with
the MetricsGrimoire name and invite you (or who?).
After this i will start building it and contribute the Dockerfile to the
projects and enable an automatic build (because we won`t do it manually ;)).

If i will need grants i will ping you again. Fine with it?

I thought: Just do it.
And here is the result:
https://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/sortinghat/pull/40
