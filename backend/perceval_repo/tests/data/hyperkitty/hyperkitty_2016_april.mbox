Subject: [Metrics-grimoire] [GrimoireLab] Presenting GrimoireLab
Message-ID: <1460624816.5581.114.camel@example.com>

Hi all,

This is to present GrimoreLab [1] to this mailing list. GrimoireLab is
intended to become a full platform for software development analytics,
from data retrieval to visualization. It is a complete redesign,
starting from scratch, of everything in MetricsGrimoire a vizGrimoire.?

After the experience of many years with *Grimoire, the idea is to write
more efficient, more flexible, more integrated and more capable tools.
For now, Bitergia is leading the developing effort, since it intends to
use GrimoireLab for its business, but anyone is welcome to join the
effort (including, of course, all of you).

If you don't mind, we intend to use this mailing list (with the tag
[GrimoireLab] in the subject, as in this message) to discuss about this
new system.

If you're interested in some more details, have a look at the
presentation I delivered recently at the Collab Summit [2].

Comments are welcome.

Saludos,

	Jesus.

Thank you Jesus.
For me it is fine to use this mailinglist.

One question: The old tools (CVSAnaly, MLStats, ...) are deprecated /
obsolete and get no further development from your side anymore?

Great.

At least for a while, we're planning to still maintain them. For now,
we're still using them, and basing some services on them. But with
time, the new tools should provide all their functionality, and likely
Bitergia will no longer actively maintain them. Which doesn't mean that
some of their developers (be them hired by Bitergia or not) still
maintain them in their own time.

Saludos,

	Jesus.
