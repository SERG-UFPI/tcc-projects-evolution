Subject: [Metrics-grimoire] MLStats may change the semantic of --force any
	time soon
Message-ID: <1457025635.7479.7.camel@calcifer.org>

Hi,

For those of you who rely in the option --force to download everything
and anything available from web directories, I pushed some changes you
may be interested in.

In the future --force may mean to download again if the archive was
already downloaded (or broken and whatnot).

If you want to download web directories, you may want to use:

$ mlstats --backend=webdirectory ...

Thus, in the future, you won't get surprise if --force changes. The
details are here:
