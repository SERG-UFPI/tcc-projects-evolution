# Releases

## Perceval 0.15.0 - (2020-06-13)

**New features:**

 * Add Rocket.Chat backend (#543)\
   Added support to fetch messages from a Rocket.Chat channel. The
   messages are fetched in an ascending order based on time when they
   were last updated. The channel information is also fetched. The tests
   have been added accordingly. The usage docs have been updated.

## Perceval 0.12 - (2018-10-02)

** New features and improvements: **

 * So far, the JSON items written to the defined output (standard output
   by default) were difficult to parse. With the option `--json-line`, each
   item will be written in one line, making easier their consumption by
   other processes.
 * New set of backends added:
   - **GoogleHits**
   - **Twitter**
 * Minor bugs were fixed and test coverage was improved.

** Backend improvements: **

 * **gitlab**
   - add merge request category
 * **github**
   - increase the number of items retrieved per page
   - add the list of commits hashed included in pull requests
 * **mediawiki**
   - optimize the number of API calls
 * **pipermail**
   - disable SSL verification


## Perceval 0.11 - (2018-05-21)

** New features improvements: **

 * Problems with namespaces were fixed. This package was not really using
   Python namespaces. When other packages, such as `perceval-mozilla` or
   `perceval-opnfv`, were installed `__init__.py` (inside `perceval`)
   were overwritten breaking the structure of the main package and making
   Perceval unusable. This release defines `perceval` as a namespace. Due
   to it, `fetch`, `find_backends` and other symbols are no longer accessible
   from the main package.
 * Mattermost backend added.


## Perceval 0.10 - (2018-04-11)

** New features and improvements: **

 * Support for Python 3.5, 3.6.
 * New set of backends added:
   - **GitLab**
   - **Launchpad**
 * `Cache` was removed in favor of `Archive`. This new feature stores, in
   SQLite databases, each data response received from a remote source. Thus,
   it is possible to retrieve original data again without accessing the remote
   source.
 * A new generic HTTP client (`HttpClient`) is available and shared by those
   backends which require to fetch data using that protocol. This client manages
   rate limits, sleep times and retries in case of error. It is fully extensible
   and configurable.
 * With the integration of categories, backends would be able to generate
   different types of items. For instance, GitHub generates issue and
   pull request items. The option `--category` allows to set which type of
   items will be fetched.
 * Gmane site shut down its activity in July 2016. Although there were some
   actions to revamp it, it is still down. For these reasons, Gmane backend
   is no longer maintained and has been removed from the core backends.
 * Tests were improved, specially, adding unit tests for Gerrit backend.
 * Perceval and GrimoireLab project are now part of CHAOSS community.

** Backend improvements: **

 * **askbot**
   - add data about accepted answers
 * **gerrit**
   - rename parameter URL to hostname
 * **git**
   - add `to-date` option to fetch data up to the given date
   - run Git commands setting HOME environment variable
   - clone data into a bare repository instead of a work copy
 * **github**
   - fetch issue comments
   - fetch issue/comments reactions
   - fetch multiple assignees
   - fetch pull request category
   - major refactoring reducing the number of requests sent by the client
 * **phabricator**
   - include project/user information in task transactions

** Bugs fixed: **

 * The process for discovering references in Git repositories failed
   with those repositories which do not have any. (#260)
 * When a local Git repository was analyzed by Perceval, the directory where
   it was cloned was created inside the local repository. (#262)
 * Sleep times when rate limit is in use were wrongly calculated in some
   cases, generating negative values. (#355)
 * Pipermail backend failed on inaccessible archive URLs. Now, it skips
   those URLs generating warning messages. (#358)

** Thanks to: **

 * Anvesh Chaturvedi
 * David Pose Fern√°ndez
 * Prabhat Sharma


## Perceval 0.9 - (2017-07-17)

** New features and improvements: **

 * DockerHub added as new backend.
 * Fetch the latest commits added in a Git repository using
   the argument `latest-items`.

** Bugs fixed: **

 * In Slack, comment messages were not processed raising an error
   when their UUIDs were computed. These messages do not include a
   'user' field on the top layer, which made the backed to fail.
   This field can be found inside 'comment' key.
 * Some versions of gerrit return number review as an integer.
   This value must be converted to string because UUIDs can only be
   generated using string values. (#144)


## Perceval 0.8 - (2017-05-15)

** New features and improvements: **

 * Common functions used across GrimoireLab projects have been moved
   to their own package. This package was named `grimoirelab-toolkit`.
   From this version, Perceval depends on this package.

** Backend improvements: **

  * **askbot**
    - support new URLs schema for comment queries
  * **bugzilla**
    - set `User-Agent` header in HTTP clients
  * **confluence**
    - add content URL to each item
  * **gerrit**
    - add option to disable SSH host keys checks
  * **nntp**
    - raise `ParseError` exceptions when an encoding error is found
  * **rss**
    - set `User-Agent` header in HTTP clients


## Perceval 0.7 - (2017-03-21)

** New features and improvements: **

 * New set of backends added:
    - Hyperkitty
    - NNTP
    - Slack
 * `RateLimitError` exception added for handling rate limit errors.
 * Code was cleaned to follow most of the PEP8 style guidelines.

** Backend improvements: **

  * **git**
    - retry calls on SSH commands were added to avoid temporal server errors
  * **github**
    - HHTP 404 errors are managed when user's organizations are fetched
    - generic `RateLimitError` exception is used

** Bugs fixed: **

 * In Mediawiki backend, the log messages written when a revision is not
   found were set to ERROR when the real level should have been WARNING.
 * The URL used to fetch jobs in Jenkins was not common to all servers.
 * When UUIDs are generated with some input data, some errors may be raised
   due to problems encoding invalid characters on the input. To avoid these
   problems, a surrogate escape control error has been set when data is
   encoded to UTF8. (#123)
 * Handle Meetup requests rate limit. (#126)


## Perceval 0.6 - (2017-02-02)

** Backend improvements: **

 * **bugzillarest**
   - messages in client errors were improved
 * **git**
   - new method `is_detached()`
 * **mbox**
   - ignore messages with invalid dates on `Date` header
 * **phabricator**
   - retry requests on HTTP 502 and 503 errors

** Bugs fixed: **

 * The `mbox` class from Python's `mailbox` module fails when it tries to
   decode non-ascii unix-from headers. This header is used as a separator
   between messages. When this error is found, the class stops reading messages
   from the mbox. Wrapping `mbox` class to override the way messages are read
   was needed to catch the exception and decode the header using UTF-8.
 * When a user does not exists on Phabricator, the API does not return an
   error. It returns an empty list. The case where an empty list is returned
   was not managed by the parser, which raised exceptions.
 * In gerrit, the identifier of the change, `Change-Id` (or `id`), is not unique.
   What it is unique in a gerrit sever is the number of each change and review.
   This `number` is used now instead of `id` as the identifier of a review
 * When Git repositories are reset to the current status on upstream, some of
   them cannot deal with `origin` reference because it is ambiguous. Replacing
   it by `FETCH_HEAD` works on those repositories with defined branches on
   the origin.
 * Git repositories in detached state do not need to be reset after `git fetch`
   is called. This call is now skipped when a repository in this state
   is in use. (#105)


## Perceval 0.5 - (2017-01-17)

** New features and improvements: **

 * New set of backends added:
    - Askbot
    - Meetup
    - RSS
 * Definition of `perceval.backends` namespace and dynamic loading of backends.
   These two features allow to have third party backends or packages of
   backends that can be imported and used at runtime.
 * Mozilla's backends were moved to their own package: `perceval-mozilla`.
 * Commands were refactorized generalizing their usage into `BackendCommand`
   class which can run any type of backend. This was possible thanks to the
   creation of `BackendCommandArgumentParser` class, that defines, manages and
   parses those arguments needed to run a command; the definition of `pre_init()`
   and `post_init()` methods during the initialization of the instance; and to
   the implementation of `setup_cache()` as a public function of the `cache`
   module.

** Backend improvements: **

 * **bugzilla**
   - set maximum number of bugs requested on CSV queries
 * **git**
   - parse commit trailers
   - new methods `is_empty()` and `count_objects()`
   - set missing encodings for the command output
   - cleaning up of the module
 * **jenkins**
   - ignore invalid job builds
 * **supybot**
   - parse action and bot empty lines
   - parse user actions with the format `*nick msg`
   - generate item ids using the body of the message

** Bugs fixed: **

 * The field 'timestamp' on metadata was not generated in UTC. The call
   to `datetime.now()` does not generate a timestamp in UTC. It does using
   the timezone of the system. The right way is to call to `datetime.utcnow()`
   method. (#92)
 * The docker image for Perceval purged the git package after installing
   `perceval`. This made impossible to run the backend for Git because
   Perceval needs of `git` command under the hood. (#95)
 * Git empty repositories threw errors while fetching commits. Those were
   raised because on empty repositories, those which do not have any history
   or are only initialized, there are some commands that cannot be run, like
   a pull or log. If any of this commands is called an error is be returned.
   It was fixed checking whether the repository is empty and returning
   an empty list of commits for those cases. (#102 and #107)


## Perceval 0.4 - (2016-11-03)

** New features and improvements: **

 * `category` field was added to items metadata to classify the type of
   the item generated with each backend.
 * The `tag` attribute added to the backends allows to mark the items
   with a custom label.
 * Two class methods, `has_caching` and `has_resuming`, are part now
   of `Backend` class interface to notify whether a backend supports
   caching and/or resuming of items.

** Backend improvements: **

 * **jenkins**
   - support blacklist of jobs
 * **mediawiki**
   - use API pages methods by default
 * **phabricator**
   - fetch and include projects data assigned to each task
 * **redmine**
   - fetch and include users data
 * **remo**
   - support new version of the API
 * **supybot**
   - parse messages written by special bots

** Bugs fixed: **

 * Filepaths on merge commits were not captured on Git backend. This was
   neccesary in those cases where merge commits only include data about
   lines added and removed because the filepaths were not parsed and
   included on the item data. (#63)
 * The `url` argument on the Gerrit backend was set to optional. It is
   mandatory. Thus, it was set to positional on the argument parser. (#60)
 * Newer versions of Phabricator fixed a bug on API Conduit regarding
   'constraints' parameter. The Phabricator client was modified to fix
   this bug, too. (#80)
 * Python's `requests` library decompresses gzip-encoded responses, but
   in some cases is only able to decompress some parts due to encoding
   issues or to mixed contents. This problem was fixed downloading and
   storing the orinal/raw data (compressed or decompressed) for furthed
   processing.
 * Jira backend did not return items in order, from oldest to newest. (#89)
 * Dates with invalid timezones were not parsed. In those cases, the
   the dates will be converted usin UTC by default. (#73)


## Perceval 0.3 - (2016-09-19)

** New features and improvements: **

 * New set of backends added:
    - Phabricator
    - Redmine
 * Add support for creating PyPi packages

** Backend improvements: **

 * **jira**
   - fetch additional information about custom fields
 * **mediawiki**
   - add a flag which ignores the MAX_RECENT_DAYS constraint when the
     backend is tested

** Bugs fixed: **

 * Cache tests for Redmine backend checked the values retrieved from the
   repository but not from the cache.
 * Timestamps generated to fetch data from a given date included invalid
   timezone information for Mediawiki API (>=1.27). It only works with Zulu
   dates. (#54)
 * Date strings that included information after the timezone were not parsed:
   `Thu, 14 Aug 2008 02:07:59 +0200 CEST`. (#57)


## Perceval 0.2 - (2016-07-20)

** New features and improvements: **

 * New set of backends added:
    - Bugzilla (REST API)
    - Confluence
    - Discourse
    - Gmane
    - Jenkins
    - Kitsune (Mozilla)
    - Mediawiki
    - Pipermail
    - ReMo (Mozilla)
    - Supybot
    - Telegram
 * The origin of the fetched data is configurable.
 * Unit tests for GitHub, Jira and Stack Exchange were added. Other tests
   were added and improved. Now, the unit tests framework covers a 83% of
   the source code.

** Backend improvements: **

 * **gerrit**
   - support server version 2.8
 * **git**
   - filtering by branches
   - so far, the full log was read before parsing it; now, it is parsed and processed
     while is being read
 * **github**
   - full control of GitHub API rate limit
   - the program can be sent to sleep until the rate limit is reset again
 * **mbox**
   - fetches messages since a given date
 * **pipermail**
   - fetches messages from a *mod_mbox* interface (i.e: Apache)

** Bugs fixed: **

 * Dates that included parentheses sections were not parsed:
   `2005 15:20:32 -0100 (GMT+1)`.
 * An encoding error was raised when `version.py` module was imported. (#32)
 * The call in chain of functions `utcnow()` and `timestamp()` from the
   module `time`, produced wrong timezones on the GitHub backend.
 * Action IRC messages (leading with a single `*`) were ignored. (#48)
 * The `backoff` field received in a Stack Exchange API response was
   ignored. When this field is set, any client must wait the number of
   seconds specified on it before sending any new request.
 * The query used in Gerrit to retrieve the reviews was badly formed when
   the blacklist filter contained two or more reviews. (#50)


## Perceval 0.1 - (2016-03-30)

** New features and improvements: **

 * Supports Python 3.4 and newer versions.
 * Fetches and caches information from several software repositories:
    - Bugzilla
    - Gerrit
    - Git
    - GitHub
    - Jira
    - MBox
    - Stack Exchange
 * Metadata fields are added to fetched items.
 * Dates and times used to request data are always converted to UTC.
 * Unit testing framework is available. Currently, these
   unit tests cover the 62% of the source code.

** Bugs fixed: **

 * Some Git commit log entries may not contain information about files.
   Before this was fixed, Perceval raised an exception with a "_Unexpected
   end of log stream_" message. (#8)
 * Empty Git commit logs raised erros when were parsed. (#17)
 * Character ^M) produced some parsing errors in the Git backend. (#21)
